## Code Breakdown
- Short program that tells some basic astrology details based on the birth month and date provided (MM DD)
- Used express as my third party app - Mostly just generates a 404 error via line 21 in the server.js file.

## Example Commands
- [Code] "node app 01 15"
- [Code] "node app 05 35" - Should generate a polite error
- [Code] "node app" or "node app 0 0" - Should generate a... less polite error.
